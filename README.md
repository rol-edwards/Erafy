Utility for converting dates with eras (i.e. BC/AD) into negative or positive numbers, for storing easily in database or doing maths on, and for reversing this. 

The dates can either be strings, or objects of the form {number: (integer), era: (BC or AD)}

The erafy_common_era module does the same but using the BCE/CE system.
